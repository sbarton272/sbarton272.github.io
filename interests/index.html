  <h1>Boy Scouts</h1>
  <p>
    <i> "A dehydrated scout is a dead scout and dead scouts have no fun" </i>
    I was involved in Boy Scouts for a number of years through my troop Rose Valley Troop 272, leadership courses and the Order of the Arrow. Backpacking, canoing, camping, climbing were all wonderful activities. I worked one summer at Philmont which was a most amazing summer experience.

  <h1>FIRST Robotics</h1>
  <p>
    In high school I was on Team 486 the Positronic Panthers in the FIRST robotics competition. We had a grand time building a crude yet capable machine in our auto-shop  and then going out on the game field and holding our own against the arc-welded machines of more privileged teams. I can thank robotics for getting me interested in engineering.

  <h1>Fencing</h1>
  <p>
    In sixth grade I met Pixie Roane and was convined that fencing was the coolest sport ever invented. I joined the Wallingford Swarthmore Pather Fencing with Pixie Roane as my coach. I've continued fencing at school with the fencing club.

  <h1>CMU Robotics Club</h1>
  <p>
    If you want to see the coolest stuff coming out of Carnegie Mellon undergrads, check out the <a href="http://roboticsclub.org/"> RoboClub</a>. I've been having fun here working on such projects as Tank Chair, Flutophone and Mechanical Logic Gates.

  <h1>CMU Buggy: FRINGE</h1>
  <p>
    Carnegie Mellon University has a very strange, unique tradition called Buggy. The basic premise is soap-box derby on steroids. The driver is a tiny girl who is crammed into a super aerodynamic bullet-shaped carbon fiber vehicle and then sent careening down a hill at 40mph. It was good fun and constructing the vehicles is quite the challenge. If this intrigues you check out the <a href="http://www.cmubuggy.org/"> website </a> or skip that and just look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cmu+buggy+crash+videos"> crash videos </a>.

  <h1>Sailing</h1>
  <p>
    My father's family grew up with wet feet. We joke that they learned to sail before learning to walk. While watered-down slightly, that tradition was kept alive. Sailing is an interesting activity because its as much of a mental game than anything else. While the young and strong certainly have an advantage, sailing bridges the generations. I know I'll be drawn to water for the rest of my life because its in my blood.

  <h1>The News</h1>
  <p>
    I've always been a bit of a news junkie. I really enjoy the Christian Science Monitor as a fairly unbiased, outside the mainstream news sources. Of course the New York Times continues to be well written. Recently, I've taken an interest in a more outside perspective on US news and have turned to the BBC and Al Jazera as two good sources. Maybe I'm a snob, but I've personally found the written word to be more informative than television news.
