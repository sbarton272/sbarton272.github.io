**[The Coda template](https://coda.io/d/Project-Retro-Template_dd0boW-t8XW/Team-Project-Retro_suWaF#_luB21)**

This is a battle-tested interactive project retrospective template that I've built. It's designed to engage the whole team, especially in remote settings where it can be hard to hear from everyone in a disucussion. To give you a better sense how this works, we'll talk through the sections.

### Solicit discussion prompts

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/coda-templates/retro-template-prompts.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

### Everyone reflects individually

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/coda-templates/retro-template-feedback.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

 Individually reflect on what went well / poorly during the quarter starting from the Feedback Prompts  (each person has a view in Reflection)

What’s Start, Stop, Continue?

* Start aka what new things should we do next quarter?
* Stop aka what things should we stop doing from the last quarter?
* Continue aka what things went well that we should keep up?

### Vote on discussion topics

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/coda-templates/retro-template-discussion.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

### Discuss and set action items

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/coda-templates/retro-template-voting.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

We’ll meet and reflect on a project. As a team we’ll be reflecting on a set of prompts.

## How to run a retrospective

- Note taker, most talkative person
- Discussion driver

[ ] Re-title this doc!
[ ] Fill in any Feedback Prompts you’d like the team to think over during their reflection. These prompts are intended to be guide people to think about specific things in their reflection.
[ ] Adjust any of the timers as you see fit in Agenda & Timers.
[ ] Read through the agenda on the main page and the individual pages to get a sense of what’s going on.
