This document outlines how I operate as a software engineering manager (EM). My hope is to give you a sense for how I approach the job and what working with me would be like. I’ve served as an engineering manager at Branch International, Digit, KoBold Metals & Klaviyo. 

If you’re just looking for the TLDR:

- I aim to be a servant leader, empowering others to succeed
- I value continuous learning and improvement
- I like to build teams based on trust, accountability, respect & a clear mission
