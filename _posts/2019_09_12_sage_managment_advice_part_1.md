My girlfriend is a grad student and therefore a sage in training. Her wisdom extends from electron scattering patterns to keeping undergrads in check.
I give her credit for all these ideas.

# Tiers of Help

You've got needy undergrads (or employees). They want your time but you've got to much to do! What to do?

### Tier 1 ðŸ˜­ Look It Up

The quickest and easiest way to provide help with minimal time to redirection. Point your mentee towards an online resource, provide a keyword or recommend they look into a certain tool. It's still on them to resolve their problem.

### Tier 2 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Talk to X

If your mentee's problem is meatier they may need more help. Perhaps one of their peers can help? You can direct them to a regional expert to answer a question or two.

### Tier 3 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Bring Questions

You're going to need to schedule some time at this point. The problems are tougher. Office hours is a good model here. Schedule a fixed and finite time for your mentee to appear with prepared questions.

### Tier 4 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Ok Let's Look at This

At this point you've exhausted other routes, it is time to sit down with your mentee and hash out the problem.
